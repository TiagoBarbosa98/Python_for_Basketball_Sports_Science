🚀 Pre-Course Setup & Resources Guide
Welcome to Python for Basketball Data Science!
This guide ensures you have all the necessary tools and accounts set up before you begin Week 1. This course uses Google Colab, which means you don't need to install any software on your personal computer—you just need a Google account.
 
1. ⚙️ Technical Setup: Google Colab
Google Colaboratory (Colab) is a free, cloud-based platform that allows you to write and execute Python code through your web browser.
Task 1: Create a Google Account
•	Requirement: You must have a Google account (Gmail) to access and save your work in Google Colab and Google Drive.
•	Action: If you do not have one, create a new Gmail account.
Task 2: Access Google Colab
•	Action: Go to the Google Colab Website.
•	Recommendation: Bookmark this link!
•	File Storage: All your notebooks (.ipynb files) and saved data (.csv files) will be automatically stored in a folder called Colab Notebooks within your Google Drive.
Task 3: Test a Notebook
1.	Open Google Colab.
2.	Click "New notebook" in the bottom right corner of the welcome dialog.
3.	In the first code cell, type: print("Setup Complete!")
4.	Click the "Play" button (▶️) next to the cell.
5.	If you see the output Setup Complete!, you are ready to start Week 1.
 
2. 📘 Essential Python/Pandas Terminology
Throughout the course, we will use specific terms to describe data and code actions. Familiarize yourself with these core concepts:
Term	What It Is	Course Context
Variable	A name used to store a specific piece of data (e.g., a player's points or a calculated rate).	Week 1
Function	A named block of reusable code that performs a specific task (e.g., calculating effective_fg).	Week 2
DataFrame	The primary data structure in the Pandas library. It's a two-dimensional table, like a spreadsheet.	Week 3
Series	A single column within a DataFrame.	Week 3
Imputation	The technique of filling in missing data points (NaN) with calculated estimates (like the mean or median).	Week 7
Feature Engineering	The process of creating new metrics (or features) from raw data (e.g., turning PTS, FGA, FTA into TS%).	Week 9
Correlation ($r$)	A statistical measure of how closely two variables relate. Closer to 1.0 means they move strongly together (positive relationship).	Week 6
 
3. 🧩 Using the Weekly Notebooks
Each week, you will perform the required tasks directly within a Jupyter Notebook.
How to Start Each Week
1.	Open your Google Drive.
2.	Navigate to the Colab Notebooks folder.
3.	Find the new assignment notebook (e.g., Week_X_Assignment.ipynb).
4.	Crucial Step: Always save a copy before starting! Go to File > Save a copy in Drive. Rename the new copy (e.g., Week_X_Assignment_MyName). This prevents you from losing the original blank version.
Key Commands (Shortcuts)
Action	Menu	Shortcut
Run Current Cell	Runtime	Shift + Enter
Add New Code Cell	Insert	Ctrl/Cmd + B
Add New Text Cell	Insert	Ctrl/Cmd + M
 
4. 📚 Data Science Stack (The Libraries)
We will use the following Python libraries for virtually all the work in this course:
Library	Standard Alias	Purpose	Weeks Used
Pandas	pd	Data cleaning, manipulation, filtering, and grouping.	All Weeks (3-10)
NumPy	np	High-performance numerical and statistical calculations (mean, correlation).	All Weeks (6-10)
Matplotlib	plt	Base library for generating plots and charts.	All Weeks (5, 6, 8, 9, 10)
Seaborn	sns	High-level library for creating complex, attractive statistical visualizations (like heatmaps).	All Weeks (5, 8, 9, 10)
Scikit-learn	sklearn	Machine Learning tasks (scaling, splitting data, training models).	Week 10
You are now fully prepared for the technical and conceptual journey of the course! Good luck!
