    "# Week 1 Assignment – Calculating Pace & Efficiency\n",
    "\n",
    "**Objective:** Apply Python basics to calculate team possessions and offensive efficiency from a real or simulated box score.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Instructions\n",
    "1. Choose one NBA game box score (from Basketball Reference or NBA.com).\n",
    "2. Collect the following stats:\n",
    "- Field Goal Attempts (FGA)\n",
    "- Free Throw Attempts (FTA)\n",
    "- Offensive Rebounds (OREB)\n",
    "- Turnovers (TO)\n",
    "- Points Scored (PTS)\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Write a Python script to:\n",
    "- Estimate possessions using the formula:  \n",
    "  `Possessions = FGA + (0.44 × FTA) – OREB + TO`\n",
    "- Calculate Offensive Efficiency:  \n",
    "  `(PTS / Possessions) × 100`\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Print the results in a clear sentence.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "**Deliverable:**\n",
    "- Submit this notebook with your code, explanations, and final results.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Extra Challenge:** Compare two teams from the same game and determine which was more efficient.\n"
